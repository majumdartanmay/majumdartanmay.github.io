ChatGPT gave a shitty description, so I had to top it with my own shitty blog description. 
  This blog mirrors the neurons which are fired in my brain when I am extremely bored. 
  I hope it becomes something more than that as time passes. But that's how it is for now. 
  I mainly code and read. So most content will be related to that.
